# CardioPredict: Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
CardioPredict is a machine learning model designed to predict the presence of heart disease based on various health metrics. This model uses classification algorithms to analyze and predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

## Key Technologies:
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Approach:
- Data preprocessing: cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering: transforming and selecting important features
- Model selection: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC

## Outcome:
- Gained practical experience with machine learning models for healthcare data
- Delivered a predictive model for heart disease classification
